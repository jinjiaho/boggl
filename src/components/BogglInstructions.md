# Boggl Instructions

## Objective
Get the highest score by forming words from the letters on the board.

## Setup
- Every player prepares a piece of paper and a pen (or pencil).

## Play
- Press "Start!" to play.
- Write down as many words as you can form with the letter dice (see "Legal words" for rules on forming words).
- When the timer runs out, compare your words with those of the other players. If you found the same words, cancel them out. See "Scoring" for more.
- The player with the highest score wins!

## Legal words
- Words must be at least 3 letters long.
- Each letter of a word should be touching the previous letter either horizontally, vertically or diagonally without any skips or jumps.
- You cannot go over the same letter die twice for a word. For example, the two N's in the word "NEON" cannot be from the same letter die.
- As long as a word can be found in a standard English dictionary, it is a legal word.
- Plural forms count as separate words from their singular forms.
- Proper nouns, contractions and non-English words do not count.

## Scoring
- When the timer runs out, take turns reading out the words on your list. If another player has the word, all players cross that word out, so only words unique to each player are counted in the end.
- Tally up the points for each remaining word. The points are counted as such:
  - 3-4 letters: 1 point
  - 5 letters: 2 points
  - 6 letters: 3 points
  - 7 letters: 5 points
  - 8 or more letters: 11 points
  - The "Qu" cube counts as 2 letters even though both letters are on the same cube.

Happy Boggling!
